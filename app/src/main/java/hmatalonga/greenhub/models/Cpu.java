	 * The value of HZ varies across kernel versions and hardware platforms. On
	 * i386 the situation is as follows: on kernels up to and including 2.4.x,
	 * HZ was 100, giving a jiffy value of 0.01 seconds; starting with 2.6.0, HZ
	 * was raised to 1000, giving a jiffy of 0.001 seconds. Since kernel 2.6.13,
	 * the HZ value is a kernel configuration parameter and can be 100, 250 (the
	 * default) or 1000, yielding a jiffies value of, respectively, 0.01, 0.004,
	 * or 0.001 seconds. Since kernel 2.6.20, a further frequency is available:
	 * 300, a number that divides evenly for the common video frame rates (PAL,
	 * 25 HZ; NTSC, 30 HZ).
	 *
	 * I will leave the unit of cpu time as the jiffy and we can discuss later.
